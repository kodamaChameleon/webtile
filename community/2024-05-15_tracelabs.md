## We crowdsource OSINT to help find missing people.
A global osintforgood non-profit focused on identifying leads to law enforcement for missing persons cases and bringing hope to the MPs family and friends.

Very beginner friendly, Trace Labs has mastered the gamification of a very serious subject. Volunteers can compete or act as judges, validating submissions from the contestants. Check out their website at [https://www.tracelabs.org/](https://www.tracelabs.org/). The community has a very active Discord channel where you can get all the latest news and alerts including finding out how to get involved with ongoing operations or the next capture the flag (CTF).
