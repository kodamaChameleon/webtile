## IDENTIFY. INTERDICT. EMPOWER.
A veteran led, faith influenced, osintforgood non-profit working together with law enforcement and a small army of volunteers to identify perpetrators of sex trafficking in the United States so that they might be brought to justice and their victims receive the support they need to accept recovery services.

The Skull Games team utilizes a jiu jitsu belt ranking system for staff and volunteers and screens their applicants for background checks and OSINT skills. If you are interested in getting involved, see their website at [https://skullgames.io/](https://skullgames.io/). "Hunts" are conducted in person around the country as well as remote team capabilities. The community is quite active in Slack for communications.
