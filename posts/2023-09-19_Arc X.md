Greetings fellow cyber-sleuths! If you’ve been traversing the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, you know the journey can be relentless. Not only must you stay ahead of the latest tech trends, but those certifications demand a never-ending stream of continuing education units (CEUs). In such a ravenous ecosystem, training providers are as plentiful as stars in the night sky. Thanks to ArcX’s free offering of Cyber Threat Intelligence 101, we got to wet our appetite on just a little of what they have to offer.

ArcX has clearly embraced the cyber vibe, crafting a website that just feels right somehow. The learner’s dashboard is your trusty sidekick, serving up metrics galore on your learning habits. From time spent immersed in riveting videos to conquering tests and labs, this dashboard tracks your digital soul (with in the confines of ArcX naturally).

Of course, a training site can have all the greatest glitz and glamour and totally lose sight of the main objectives. The core competencies of CTI 101 were well laid out and included Objectives of Threat Intelligence, Intro to Threat Actors, Intro to Law and Ethics, the Intelligence Cycle, and Threat Vectors. Each section includes video training as well as supplemental reading material and knowledge checks. Overall, I spent approximately 8.5 hours on this course and can say that the pacing felt just about right, not too fast and not too slow.

Just so we’re clear, ArcX is not slipping me any sort of compensation for this review. Some things are just too good not to share. The company was founded back in December of 2020, so they are still relatively new. Based out of the UK, they advertise their affiliations with veterans of the British Royal Marines. Perhaps that’s where they get their unique style and flair – they’re like the James Bond of the cyber-education world.

If I haven’t convinced you yet, I’m not sure what will. As for this chameleon, I’ll be keeping an eye out for any more discounted training. They’ve earned themselves a loyal, color-camouflaging fan, and I’m betting you’ll become one too. Happy cyber-sleuthing! 🦎💻🕵️‍♀️
