![Blog Freeze](/static/img/frozen_book.png)

Hello readers! Life happens. For this chameleon that means putting a pause to blogging. It’s been a great adventure that I hope to pick up again one day, but when I assess all the competing priorities in life right now, something has to go.

In a world of so much competing noise, you, the reader, deserve quality information and analysis. That quality takes time, time that I don’t have right now. Hope to see you again in the future!
