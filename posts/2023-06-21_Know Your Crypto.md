If you are considering expanding your knowledge of cryptocurrency and have looked into certification options, you may have come across the Certified Cryptocurrency Intelligence (CCI) course offered by Blockchain Intelligence Group (BIG). Before jumping in and paying the $$$, you may want to read on to better decide if this course is a good fit for you.

The importance of understanding cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in the realm of Cyber Threat Intelligence cannot be overstated. As the digital landscape evolves, criminals are finding innovative ways to exploit cryptocurrencies for their illicit activities. In this regard, the CCI course is a game-changer. It equips analysts with the necessary skills to identify and mitigate potential threats lurking within the blockchain ecosystem.

The first question you should probably ask yourself is, “how new to crypto are you?” This course seems to target the very beginner being as they advertise no prior experience necessary. If you are looking to advance your knowledge and are already familiar with blockchain technology, various types of cryptocurrencies, and how they might be exploited, then this course is probably not for you. But you might ask, “What if I just need a certificate?” Well, in that case, maybe. If your company is footing the bill or you are able to get a steep discounted rate, then this would be a great cert to curl your tail around.

If you are new to crypto, this course does an excellent job of covering all the basics! There is built in repetition between the modules which is a common learning technique, though it can feel a bit redundant and cumbersome at times. The tests are pretty forgiving. Make sure to take good notes on the lesson review quizzes (hint hint, nudge nudge).

Particularly in the later modules, portions of the module are dedicated to explaining BIG’s product called QLUE. Obviously this is a shameless sales pitch to law enforcement to buy a subscription to their tools. QLUE offers some incredible methods for exploring the blockchains of various cryptocurrencies; however, this chameleon will always be biased towards open-source software such as Maltego.

The CCI course remains an invaluable resource for those interested in cryptocurrency intelligence, particularly in the area of law enforcement. BIG’s commitment to equipping analysts with the necessary skills to combat emerging threats is commendable. The course provides a comprehensive foundation in understanding blockchain technology, enabling professionals to stay one step ahead in the ever-evolving cyber landscape.
