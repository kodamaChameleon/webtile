In today’s article, we want to shine a spotlight on an extraordinary #osintforgood non-profit founded by Jeff Tiegs, known as Skull Games. Skull Games won OSMOSISCON Non-Profit of the Year for 2023. Their mission is to harness the power of open-source intelligence (OSINT) in the battle against sex trafficking in the United States. Their latest event, set against the notorious backdrop of New Orleans, not only serves as a testament to their relentless determination but also shines a light on the profound significance of their mission.

Sex trafficking, as one pimp chillingly put it, “is not a sex game, it’s a skull game.” Volunteering in an event, known as a hunt, is not for the faint of heart. Exposing oneself to the reality behind such a glamorized industry can lead to what’s known as Vicarious Trauma (VT) commonly associated with first responders. Unlike many altruistic activities that leave participants with a warm, satisfied feeling, there are no ‘happy feels’ in the aftermath of a hunt. Instead, there’s a bittersweet wish that lingers – ‘if only I could do more.’ As the event concludes, the victims remain out there while all the hunters can go home.

One of the unique qualities of volunteering in the #osintforgood community is the ability for remote participation. That being said, participating in a hunt in person is unquestionably the preferred method. The various teams do an excellent job of including their remote participants, but nothing really compares to energy created by in person gatherings.

As the organization grows, doubtless more and more critiques will seek to attack Skull Games. More volunteers increases workload capacity but also the risks of misrepresenting core values. From this chameleon’s perspective, the heartbeat of Skull Games is the desire to see that all people are empowered to choose their own destiny in life free from force, fraud, or coercion whatever form those shackles may take.
